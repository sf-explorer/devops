# SF Explorer Devops Rules

A set of [declarative rules](./defaultRules.js) allowing to perform simple checks on your orgs with SF Explorer Engine

## Pipeline integration
Create a file named `.env` with the following content:
```bash
SFEXP_LOGIN=XXX # remove it to use SFDX instead
SFEXP_PASSWORD=XXX # Password+SecurityToken, remove it to use SFDX instead
LOGINURL=https://login.salesforce.com #or https://test.salesforce.com
DATE=TODAY  #or 2024-01-01
RULES=EntityDefinition,CustomField  #specify to only run rules on EntityDefinition and CustomField - remove param to check all rules
```

Run the command:  
```cmd
npx @sf-explorer/devops.cli
```
The command will generate an output file name `testReport.xml` similar to the one you can find [here](./cli/test-report.xml).


If you don't provide a username, it will try to connect using `SFDX`
